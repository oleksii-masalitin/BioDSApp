There are my code examples in this folder

1) The first directory contains a file with a realization of a complex numbers class and several functions for this class (including a^b). The second file implements solving a quadratic equation using this class.

2) The second directory solves the problem of finding the fastest flight between two cities, taking the information from the respective xlsx file.

3) The third directory solves an olympiad programming problem which could be found here: https://www.eolymp.com/uk/problems/1517.

4) The fourth directory is a collection of Python Numpy and Matplotlib libraries tasks, which I completed during the Data Science Fundamentals course from DataRoot Labs.
