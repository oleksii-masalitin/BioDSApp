There are my code examples in this folder

1) First directory contains a file with a realization of a complex numbers class and several functions for this class (including a^b). Second file implements solving a quadratic equation using this class.

2) Second directory solves a problem of finding the fastest flight between two cities, taking the information from the respective xlsx file.

3) Third directory solves an olympiad programming problem which could be found here: https://www.eolymp.com/uk/problems/1517.
